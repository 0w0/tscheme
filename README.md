### Propose
While reading [SCIP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), It makes me interest in LISP-like language,
Then I searched on web, I found a quite interesting tutorial to implement a LISP(scheme) interpreter
in a scripting language(`Python`).

So I decided to implement one in `Typescript`.

Reference link: [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)
### Preview
Using `Typescript` rather than `Vanilla JavaScript` is overkill, since it's only a single module and not so complex.
But still, it's good to target the implementation into `JavaScript`, it runs in every browser for convenience.

Anyway, it's far away from R5RS (scheme standard, and now it's R6S6), such as mentioned in [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).
But it's nice to know how scheme(Lisp) work.
